# Welcome to 52 Side Hustles

## Inspiration

In the 1977 book The Entrepreneur's Manual chapter 2 is called "Let's screw our heads on right" one of the sections has stuck with me for more than a decade since I first read it: Establish your personal mini-incomes.

> There is no alibi for any qualified individual in America not to realise a minimum of $2,000 a month (or $20 an hour) from his non-prime hours (evenings and weekends)

This is the equivalent of $10,000 in today's money! They go on:

> Realize that it only takes ten $200/month mini incomes to meet your $2,000/month goal. There are thousands of $200/month opportunities.

I want to follow in these footsteps but update the goals for 2025, there is still more good advice that follows:

> 1. Each mini-income must be enjoyable and fall within the client's lifestyle.
> 2. Each mini-income should produce a minimum of $20 ($100 in 2025) in profits for each hour the client invests in it.
> 3. Once the initial spade work is completed, the mini income is operating correctly, and the product (or service) appears reliable, our client should then pass on day-to-day operations to others and just supervise the operation. This will free up enough time for them to address another mini-income.
> 4. Each mini-income should be continuous in nature so that the client can lean on it's profits when they quit their full time job and begin their startup.
> 5. Each mini-income should supply our client with at least $500 ($2,500 in 2025) per year in cash reserves which they can either use as "front" money for more mini incomes or invest in his start-up on an as-needed basis.

While I have no intention of leaving my full time role as I am really enjoying it the mini-incomes or side-hustles will scratch my entrepreneurial itch!

To establish these mini-incomes I thought I would challenge myself to create a new one each week! Hence the 52 Side Hustle Challenge!

## What is the 52 Side Hustles Challenge?

The 52 Side Hustles Challenge is an experiment in rapid entrepreneurship and learning. Each week, I am going to:

1. Choose and start a new side hustle
2. Document the experience and initial results
3. Evaluate its potential
4. Decide whether to continue or move on

Building side hustles is super hard, often one of the major issues I have getting started is analysis paralysis.

By challenging myself to try new side hustle each week there is a forcing function to just launch something and see whether anyone is interested.
