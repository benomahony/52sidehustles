## What is the 52 Side Hustles Challenge?

The 52 Side Hustles Challenge is an experiment in rapid entrepreneurship and learning. Each week, participants:

1. Choose and start a new side hustle
2. Document the experience and initial results
3. Evaluate its potential
4. Decide whether to continue or move on

## Why Take This Challenge?

Building side hustles is super hard, often one of the major issues getting started is analysis paralysis.

By challenging yourself to try new side hustle each week there is a forcing function to just launch something and see whether anyone is interested.

## How It Works

1. **Choose**: Select a side hustle from our growing database or try your own
2. **Launch**: Spend 5-10 hours setting up and running your chosen hustle
3. **Evaluate**: Assess the viability of the side hustle _for you_
4. **Decide**: Continue promising ventures or document lessons learned
