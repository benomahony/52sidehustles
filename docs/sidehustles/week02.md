## How To

First you do need the experience of editing many CVs! Many of you will know I started my career in recruitment so I have seen more CVs than I could count!

However if you have been a hiring manager for a long time this could also be something that you have experience with for your industry.

In terms of getting started practically some quick googling suggested fiver.com as a very quick way of getting started.started

Getting going was relatively painless with a specific category already for editing resumes so creating the page was quite simple.

Unfortunately my profile seems to have been stuck in $ USD mode so the prices are a bit weird imho.

One thing to note is that most of the messages received so far (on Etsy and Fiverr) seem to be fraudulent and relatively sophisticated:

This is doubly annoying as I am still waiting for the first revenue so these notifications are exactly what I want to see!

Luckily Fiverr and Etsy have several messages reinforcing not to share personal information so kudos to them!

So here is the resulting gig: [I will create, review and edit your software engineering CV](https://www.fiverr.com/benomahony007/create-review-and-edit-your-software-engineering-cv)

To make this a bit more easy I also looked into [LaTeX CVs](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV)
