They go on:</p> <p>Realize that it only takes ten $200/month mini incomes to meet your $2,000/month goal. There are thousands of $200/month opportunities.</p> <p>I want to follow in these footsteps but update the goals for 2025, there is still more good advice that follows:</p> <ol> <li>Each mini-income must be enjoyable and fall within the client's lifestyle.</li> <li>Each mini-income should produce a minimum of $20 ($100 in 2025) in profits for each hour the client invests in it.</li> <li>Once the initial spade work is completed, the mini income is operating correctly, and the product (or service) appears reliable, our client should then pass on day-to-day operations to others and just supervise the operation. This will free up enough time for them to address another mini-income.</li> <li>Each mini-income should be continuous in nature so that the client can lean on it's profits when they quit their full time job and begin their startup.</li> <li>Each mini-income should supply our client with at least $500 ($2,500 in 2025) per year in cash reserves which they can either use as \"front\" money for more mini incomes or invest in his start-up on an as-needed basis.</li> </ol> <p>While I have no intention of leaving my full time role as I am really enjoying it the mini-incomes or side-hustles will scratch my entrepreneurial itch!</p> <p>To establish these mini-incomes I thought I would challenge myself to create a new one each week! Hence the 52 Side Hustle Challenge!</p>"},{"location":"#what-is-the-52-side-hustles-challenge","title":"What is the 52 Side Hustles Challenge?","text":"<p>The 52 Side Hustles Challenge is an experiment in rapid entrepreneurship and learning.

To","text":"<p>This first side hustle scratched our own itch of having a annual planner that also incorporated goals, for the year and also monthly. A quick google and we found gelato.com who do print to order, integrate with Etsy (and Shopify, etc.) and also have a pretty decent api which I could use for extensions.</p> <p>For the first iteration we want the absolute minimum required to be able to sell and fulfil an order which requires the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Design annual planner</li> <li>Upload to Gelato</li> <li>Setup Etsy &amp; Shopify store</li> </ol> <p>Now I am crap with design tools and I already had it in my mind that I wanted to create my own app/landing page for this for customisation so I immediately asked Claude and ChatGPT how I could create this.</p> <p>They both suggested <code>reportlab</code> as a way to programmatically create the pdfs required by Gelato but both completely buggered up the formatting requiring some odd tweaks to make sure the pdf looked nice.</p> <p>Already we have an annoying iterative workflow so I thought I could use <code>watchfiles</code> to re-run the pdf generation on every save!</p> <pre><code>from watchfiles import run_process\n\n\ndef rebuild():\n    import subprocess\n\n    subprocess.run([\"python\", \"sidehustles/01_calendar_goals/main.py\"])\n    print(\"Reloading pdf\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_process(\"sidehustles/01_calendar_goals/main.py\", target=rebuild)\n</code></pre> <p>Voila! A much tighter iteration cycle out of the box! Similar to my experience in <code>mkdocs</code> using <code>mkdocs serve</code></p> <p> I quickly got the formatting to where I wanted and uploaded the pdf to gelato.com, selecting the A3 matte poster so it can be written on.</p> <p>I definitely have some UX feedback for Gelato, Etsy and Shopify - It should be way easier to get started with these tools.</p> <p>Gelato kept recommending new products rather than the templates I had, also I think templates isn't the best name. Ideally I'd have products for my store but I had to create a template then turn it into a product.</p> <p>This wasn't that intuitive but I got going and started creating the stores. Etsy was \u00a312 and the on boarding was quite a faff, I guess this is useful to avoid spam stores etc. but i feel there is a nicer middleground.</p> <p>Shopify was free for 3 days then \u00a31 for the first month so relatively cheap.</p> <p>Check out the Etsy store here.</p> <p>And the Shopify store here!</p> <p>So now I have the complete loop working I have two options:</p> <ol> <li>Create customisation and tracking with python?</li> <li>Look into adverts?</li> </ol> <p>Obviously 1 is more appealing to the dev but 2 looks like it might be the more useful for generating cash.
